# MLF Legends — Quality assurance and evidence

**Scope note:** GitHub repository and serialized Unity project settings can be reviewed, but Editor tests have **not** been performed directly by this assistant. On **2026-10-25**, the project owner reported **all Stage 00 tests PASSED**. This is an **owner-reported PASS**, without attached XML/log evidence; it is not an independently audited run.

**Non-blocking delivery rule (approved 2026-10-25):** The owner currently cannot run Unity tests from their environment. This MUST NOT block committing, merging or pushing requested changes, nor prevent moving on to subsequent implementation tasks. Perform every feasible static check, label Unity checks **NOT RUN**, record the residual risk and verify later when execution becomes possible. Delivery is not the same as test approval.

## Stage 00 findings and checklist
- [x] `HolyPenguin21/mlf-legends` exists; GitHub App repository access repaired and write validated.
- [x] `Assets/`, `Packages/` and `ProjectSettings/` exist in `main`.
- [x] `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` reads `6000.5.4f1`.
- [x] `Packages/manifest.json`: `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal` **17.5.0**, `com.unity.inputsystem` **1.19.0**.
- [x] `Packages/packages-lock.json` includes Burst **1.8.29** and Collections **6.5.0** as transitive dependencies.
- [x] `ProjectSettings/GraphicsSettings.asset` points to a render pipeline asset; QualitySettings PC quality also points to a render pipeline asset.
- [x] Initial project documentation added (README, Docs/ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, COMBAT_SPEC, DECISIONS, QA).
- [ ] Confirm renderer asset and smoke scene instantiate correctly in Unity Editor.
- [x] User added `com.unity.entities` **6.5.0** and `com.unity.entities.graphics` **6.5.0** to manifest and lockfile. Both are Unity 6000.5 core packages.
- [ ] Verify Unity Editor imports the two core packages without package or compiler errors.
- [ ] Verify package dependency resolution in the editor.
- [x] Created EditMode and PlayMode test assemblies with committed `.meta` GUIDs; staged ECS lifecycle, URP asset, and SampleScene load smoke tests on feature branch.
- [x] **OWNER-REPORTED PASS (2026-10-25):** all Stage 00 EditMode and PlayMode tests passed, per project owner. XML/Editor logs not provided; independent verification not performed.
- [ ] Retain optional independent scene/Console review for later; owner-reported passing PlayMode test includes existing SampleScene load.
- [ ] CI remains pending local tests and a viable Unity license/runner strategy; no GitHub Actions workflow currently configured.
- [x] Record owner-reported test PASS and accept Stage 00 for planning purposes. CI and independent log review remain optional follow-ups; do not represent them as completed.

## How to run tests (Windows; Unity Editor must be closed)

In Unity GUI: open **Window > General > Test Runner**; run **EditMode** tests, then **PlayMode** tests. Use Unity 6000.5.4f1.

In PowerShell from repository root:

```powershell
.\Tools\Run-UnityTests.ps1 -EditorPath 'C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.5.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe' -Mode EditMode
.\Tools\Run-UnityTests.ps1 -EditorPath 'C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.5.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe' -Mode PlayMode
```

The script requires a nonzero NUnit test count with all tests passing; it saves XML and Editor log to ignored `TestResults/`. Command-line testing can require an available Editor license. **Running these commands is optional for delivery**; when unavailable, keep Unity tests marked NOT RUN and continue via static review. If either suite fails when eventually executed, log the failure and fix it; do not mark the stage VERIFIED before actual evidence.

## Required review/check method
1. Inspect code and existing callers before modifying.
2. Search for competing authoritative processors and duplicate functionality.
3. Trace effects: input → commands → actor state → collision → attack/guard → injury → render and AI.
4. Cover edge cases, interruptions, cleanup, multi-hit and simultaneous events.
5. Separate EditMode automated tests from PlayMode/full integration tests; list NOT RUN clearly.
6. Use seed-controlled replay where possible; disclose limits of deterministic floating-point across platforms.
7. Record CPU/GPU profiles including actor count, environment, target hardware and frame/tick timing.
8. Write regression findings with test command/Unity version/commit SHA.

## Stage-specific profiling
- 1v1: response timing, invalid actions, front/back guard, dash, injury capability limits.
- 4v4, 16v16, 50v50, 200v200: sim time/tick, collision pairs, AI decisions, GPU batches, allocations, sprite sorting and camera.
- Navigation terrain edits only after stage 11–13 systems exist.
