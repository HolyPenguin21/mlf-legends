# MLF Legends — Quality assurance and evidence

**Scope note:** GitHub repository and serialized Unity project settings can be reviewed, but compilation or play-mode execution has **not** been performed by this assistant. Never confuse configuration inspection with passed Editor tests.

## Stage 00 findings and checklist
- [x] `HolyPenguin21/mlf-legends` exists; GitHub App repository access repaired and write validated.
- [x] `Assets/`, `Packages/` and `ProjectSettings/` exist in `main`.
- [x] `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` reads `6000.5.4f1`.
- [x] `Packages/manifest.json`: `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal` **17.5.0**, `com.unity.inputsystem` **1.19.0**.
- [x] `Packages/packages-lock.json` includes Burst **1.8.29** and Collections **6.5.0** as transitive dependencies.
- [x] `ProjectSettings/GraphicsSettings.asset` points to a render pipeline asset; QualitySettings PC quality also points to a render pipeline asset.
- [x] Initial project documentation added (README, Docs/ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, COMBAT_SPEC, DECISIONS, QA).
- [ ] Confirm renderer asset and smoke scene instantiate correctly in Unity Editor.
- [ ] Install, resolve and commit suitable Entities and (if selected) Entities Graphics package versions. They do not appear as top-level dependencies in currently inspected `manifest.json`.
- [ ] Verify package dependency resolution in the editor.
- [ ] Create assembly definitions and EditMode baseline test; execute test.
- [ ] Open a gameplay smoke scene and check Console/Play Mode.
- [ ] Set up actual GitHub Actions Unity test/build checks (or record missing runner/license as blocker).
- [ ] Log test evidence; only then promote Stage 00 to VERIFIED.

## Required review/check method
1. Inspect code and existing callers before modifying.
2. Search for competing authoritative processors and duplicate functionality.
3. Trace effects: input → commands → actor state → collision → attack/guard → injury → render and AI.
4. Cover edge cases, interruptions, cleanup, multi-hit and simultaneous events.
5. Separate EditMode automated tests from PlayMode/full integration tests; list NOT RUN clearly.
6. Use seed-controlled replay where possible; disclose limits of deterministic floating-point across platforms.
7. Record CPU/GPU profiles including actor count, environment, target hardware and frame/tick timing.
8. Write regression findings with test command/Unity version/commit SHA.

## Stage-specific profiling
- 1v1: response timing, invalid actions, front/back guard, dash, injury capability limits.
- 4v4, 16v16, 50v50, 200v200: sim time/tick, collision pairs, AI decisions, GPU batches, allocations, sprite sorting and camera.
- Navigation terrain edits only after stage 11–13 systems exist.
